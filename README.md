LavaStorm
=========
[LavaStorm](http://ay60dxg.com/projects/lavastorm/ "LavaStorm Home Page") automates job submission into OpenLava (Or LSF) for testing and validation of the scheduling system. LavaStorm submits an arbitrary number of jobs, randomly selecting projects, queues, job size, and run time within predefined limits set by the user.

The submitted jobs execute and consume resources for the time specified before exiting. This is ideal when you want to check that the cluster is functioning normally before handing it over for end user access.
